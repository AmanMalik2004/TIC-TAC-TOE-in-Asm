# TIC-TAC-TOE in Assembly (asm)

## Overview
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game created in Assembly language using the Irvine32 library. Players alternate turns to place their 'O' or 'X' on a 3x3 board. The game checks for a winner or a draw after every turn.

## Features
- Two players (Player 1 uses 'O' and Player 2 uses 'X')
- Simple console-based input and output
- Validates user moves and checks for game-ending conditions (win/draw)
- Displays the current board after each move

## How to Run
1. Install **MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)** and **Irvine32** library.
2. Assemble and link the `source.asm` file using MASM.
3. Run the compiled executable and follow the prompts to play the game.

## Conclusion
This is a basic Assembly implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditions, and basic I/O handling in Assembly.
